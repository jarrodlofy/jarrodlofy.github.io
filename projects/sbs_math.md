summary: Step-By-Step Mathematics was a mathematics teaching mobile application for 1st and 2nd graders that focused on showing the procces of solving problems and showing how they connect to previous matematics concepts.

Step-By-Step Mathematics was a Undergruadate Research and Development project that I proposed in Fall of 2015 and was approved for Spring 2016. When our application was concieved the applications focus was to focus on showing and visualizing the process of solving mathematics problems. I felt that understanding the process and making connections between the real world and the process of mathematics is crucial to comprehension. All too often, in teaching, a question is asked and the student is told if they are wrong or not. Think of all the Xâ€™s on every test you've ever taken, generally teachers just don't have the time or resources to explain the mistake.

Step-By-Step Mathematics aimed to make up for those shortcomings, and through the Spring Semester my team and I developed the application.By the end of the semester we had a project that we were proud of, the application covered 11 different lessons covering Common Core Mathematics requirments for both 1st and 2nd graders. Each lesson worked to connect itself to previous lessons in order to show the connections between mathematics concepts. At the end of the semester we presented my groups work at the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program Showcase for Spring 2016 and got first place at the poster presentation. Though I did work on many things during the project, the main thing I learned over the course of the project was how to better manage and guide a team to create an application on time and on budget.
