Below is an essay I wrote about how life long learning will impact my future as an engineer that I had written in my final semester as an engineering student.

Engineering is an interesting degree as I was recently looking at a the fact that 20% of fortune 500 CEO’s were engineers, and personally I think it is due to analytical skills gained while working towards an undergraduate degree. Learning how to learn is the most important part of becoming an engineer. When I started engineering and switched from architecture I was essentially lazy when it came to education, I wanted the information, and I wanted it spoon fed. I didn’t want to work for it, I didn’t expect someone to push me. It isn’t the information that is important, once in the workforce I don’t think I’ll ever be asked to memorize something. It’s much more important to understand why than to just have an answer.  

The passion for these types of things comes with time, it is established with an addiction to success. Engineering is difficult and that’s that reason not everybody does it, and with each success in doing something you never imagined doing a love is formed that almost addictive. There needs to be a new problem to solve.

Referencing back to the 20% of CEOS are engineers, it becomes apparent that engineers can do almost anything. The analytical abilities established carry through for our entire life. This allows for engineers to solve any problem from how to build a bridge or how to build a better company. Civil engineering is the profession of fining civic solutions, it is about building a better tomorrow. Whether that is done by researching a new material of by designing a better solution all of it has the public’s health and safety at heart. 

The best part about engineering is that there are always new things being developed whether that be new materials or new construction methods.  Flipping a burger at McDonalds will be the exact same 30 years from now I can’t really imagine there being major technological advancements in the industry, yet in engineering there are always new ideas being generated. As a chemical engineer new synthesis can create unexpected solutions, environmental engineers always have new tech to work with, and civil engineers always have new materials in order to improve design. 

Life long learning is important then because when better solutions become available it becomes more efficient to use them. If we didn’t we wouldn’t be engineers pushing the envelope of what is possible. It's always necessary to understand that you may not know everything and that an answer or a solution can come from the most unlikely of places. It can come from a construction worker who has been doing the job for 20 years. It can come from an article you browsed through that had a new take on an engineering subject. It might even come from someone younger than you that may teach you a totally different way of looking at things. If we are not open to learning after school there will not be any evolution and no progress. 
School essentially installs information, the difference between information and knowledge is experience. By physically working with other people and solving unique problems we can better understand our information by using our knowledge. Constantly keeping up with new developments is important as new tech, designs, and materials are always being set forth. 
My personal experience at UH is that the engineering department is pretty diverse in its ability. There are plenty of teachers who expect you to learn and to think critically, but equally the same amount of teachers that may shovel material and information and don’t necessarily push you. However I have run into more teachers that push me than otherwise, I can’t really compare the education from here to anywhere else as I haven’t studied as an engineer anywhere else, however I can say that I do feel that my potential is being reached. I personally feel much more intelligent, hard working, and analytical that when starting my degree. It’s interesting to watch myself go from hating math and problems my freshman year to loving them by my junior year here.
